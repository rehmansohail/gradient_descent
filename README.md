This is a gradient descent optimisation technique on linear regression  
given a training dataset, i found the optimal learning rate and number of iterations  
to calculate the optimal regression coefficients  
then i used these coefficients to calculate the predicted values on a test dataset  
the predicted values are getting saved to the file "y_predicted.csv" in the Gradient Descent folder
